# üö® CRITICAL ISSUES - IMMEDIATE FIX NEEDED

## Current Status
The vanilla JS version is loading but showing **BLANK PAGES** for:
- ‚ùå Profile page - dark/blank
- ‚ùå Leaderboard - dark/blank  
- ‚ùå PPT Converter - dark/blank
- ‚úÖ Hackathons - WORKING (showing UI)
- ‚úÖ Resume Builder - WORKING (showing forms)
- ‚úÖ Daily Quest - PARTIALLY WORKING (showing some UI)

## Root Cause
The pages ARE rendering but either:
1. Missing CSS/Tailwind classes
2. Authentication blocking content
3. JavaScript errors preventing render

## What You're Seeing in React (Port 5176)
- Full working Leaderboard with top 10 users
- Complete Profile page with avatar, stats, skills
- Working PPT Converter
- All features 100% functional

## What's in Vanilla JS (Port 8080) 
- Basic component shells
- Missing actual content rendering
- Dark/blank pages

## SOLUTION NEEDED
Copy EXACT React component logic to vanilla JS:
1. Leaderboard - top 10 users, rankings, XP display
2. Profile - avatar, bio, stats, achievements  
3. PPT Converter - file upload, conversion UI
4. Fix CSS/Tailwind rendering issues

## Files That Need URGENT Update
1. `js-webapp/js/components/UserProfile.js` - Currently incomplete
2. `js-webapp/js/components/PlaceholderComponents.js` - Has Leaderboard & PPT stub
3. CSS/Tailwind not loading properly

The vanilla JS version has the STRUCTURE but not the ACTUAL FEATURES from React!
