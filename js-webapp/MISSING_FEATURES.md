4. Add camera/timer overlays
5. Create proper test cases UI
6. Implement code execution
7. Add proper console output

### **Phase 3: Complete Missing Components** (Priority: HIGH)
1. Daily Quest System
2. Game Hub
3. User Profile

## ⚠️ CURRENT STATUS

**Overall Completion: ~30%** (Not 68% as previously stated)

**Reason**: While basic structure exists, critical features like Monaco Editor, camera/timer overlays, settings panel, and proper interactivity are completely missing.

**What needs to be done**: Complete rebuild with proper libraries and exact React feature parity.
